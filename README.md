# KSP-Snippet-Maker

Application that reads a KSP (Kontakt Script) file and makes a folder of snippets for the functions and macros. 

To run the application, just choose either the Mac App or the .exe file and double-click it. 
This was built for a specific use but it should work in most situations. The source code is open source but requires the JUCE library.

Original build by Sam Windell. Porting for Mac OS X by Davide Magni. Mac OS X 10.8 or above is required.
